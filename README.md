Boredom can be a major issue, especially during quarantine. *Give Me Entertainment,* can give you something to do, or, it can give you an idea of what you might want to do.

### Motivation
During quarantine, many people have found themselves bored. In order to keep a level of enthusiasm, I wanted to make a website with multiple tasks for people to do, as well as recommending new things to try out. :smile:

### Code

At the top of the web page, you are greeted with the welcome section, introducing the user to the website.

This is what the music section looks like. All of the other sections are similar.
